# The Bifrost solidity contracts

_WARNING: Bridge is still under development. Do not send your assets to any of the addresses_

The Bifrost bridge allows you to swap assets across blockchains. In the first iteration, the swap is based on the wrapped assets.

## Contracts for other networks:

- [TON](https://github.com/bifrost-defi/bifrost-ton-contracts)
- [Tezos](https://github.com/bifrost-defi/bifrost-tzs-contracts)
